##Project #1

* ```read_csv_notebook.ipynb``` and ```completed/read_csv_notebook_complete.ipynb```
    * Now that we have some building blocks, let's write a program already
        * We will download a csv file from the Internet
        * We will open it using Python
        * Loop through each row of the file print the data

* ```filter_csv_notebook.ipynb``` and ```completed/filter_csv_notebook_complete.ipynb```
    * We know how to download a csv file and read its contents. Let's see if we can search the output for a specific value. We'll create a new csv file in Python and we will write the results to it.
