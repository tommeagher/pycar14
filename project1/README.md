##Project #1

* ```read_csv_notebook.ipynb``` and ```completed/read_csv_notebook_complete.ipynb```

    * Now that we have some building blocks, let's write a program already

        * Download a csv file

        * Open it

        * Loop through each row and print the data

* ```filter_csv_notebook.ipynb``` and ```completed/filter_csv_notebook_complete.ipynb```

    * We know how to download a csv file and read its contents. Let's see if we can search the output for a specific value, then write the results to a new csv.
