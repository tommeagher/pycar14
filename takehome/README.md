#Resources

##Get your machine ready
* How to install Python on Mac ([find your terminal](http://learncodethehardway.org/cli/book/cli-crash-course.html#mac-osx) and type 'python') and [Windows](http://www.anthonydebarros.com/2014/02/16/setting-up-python-in-windows-8-1/) machines.
* __virtualenv__ (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) and __virtualenvwrapper__ (http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), for keeping your projects sandboxed in an easy to manage way. Here's one good [tutorial](http://blog.fruiapps.com/2012/06/An-introductory-tutorial-to-python-virtualenv-and-virtualenvwrapper) and [another](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
* Install [iPython](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/install/install.html) by typing 'pip install ipython' for the souped-up interactive interpreter.
* [version control](http://www.tommeagher.com/blog/2013/02/learning-to-commit-to-version-control.html) with __[git](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)__ and __[Github](https://help.github.com/articles/be-social)__

##Keep Practicing
Try our "[PyCAR basics](https://www.wakari.io/sharing/bundle/tommeagher/PyCAR_basics)" iPython notebook to continue exploring data types and simple methods, or look at the commented [code in Python](PyCAR_basics.py).
Tony DeBarros also taught a fantastic class at NICAR on [getting started with Python](https://github.com/anthonydb/python-get-started).

Here's a great [cheatsheet](http://sleet.aos.wisc.edu/~gpetty/wp/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Python_qr.pdf) for basic python types and functions. And you should probably bookmark this fun and handy graphic of [common Python errors](http://i.imgur.com/WRuJV6r.png).
It's worth your time to take a look at Tony DeBarros' [Python snippets](https://github.com/anthonydb/python-snippets), scripts for common tasks he's found useful.

##Good libraries to explore
* __[csv](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/systems-programming/using-the-csv-module-in-python/)__, for working with the [best tabular data format](http://pymotw.com/2/csv/).
* The __[re](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/regular-expressions)__ library for matching text with [regular expressions](http://docs.python.org/2/howto/regex.html).
* __[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)__, a library for more easily making requests to web urls. One good [tutorial](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/) and [another](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/requests/using-requests-in-python).
* __[BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)__, for parsing html or xml, with [a gentle introduction](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/beautifulsoup/beautifulsoup-4-python) and [another tutorial](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/beautifulsoup/web-scraping-with-beautifulsoup).
* __mechanize__. [A tutorial](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/mechanize/browsing-in-python-with-mechanize/) with its own [cheat sheet](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/cheatsheet/python-mechanize-cheat-sheet)
* __json__. [Work with json](http://pymotw.com/2/json/) like it's a dictionary.
* __[SQLite3](http://zetcode.com/db/sqlitepythontutorial/)__. Use the easy, built-in SQLite database engine.
* __[peewee](http://peewee.readthedocs.org/en/latest/peewee/quickstart.html)__, an orm that lets you do your SQL in Python.
* __[python-twitter](https://github.com/bear/python-twitter)__ is good for interacting with the Twitter API.
* __[Xlrd](http://www.python-excel.org/)__. Do your Excel in Python.
* __[pandas](https://manishamde.github.io/blog/2013/03/07/pandas-and-python-top-10/)__, for data analysis. pandas' dataframe object is like a table.
* And a cool collection of quick overviews on standard library modules.

##Support
Want advice on debugging? This blog post on two young girls learning to code is a very cool introduction to [how to debug a program](http://vocamus.net/dave/?p=1632). There's also a good post [on thinking about debugging programs](http://p5js.org/tutorials/debugging/) in general from the community behind p5.js. And we have this [cheatsheet for how to read your Python error messages](https://github.com/ireapps/pycar/tree/master/debug/DebugginginPython.pdf).

As we said in the class, with this mini boot camp, you get a lifetime support guarantee [from us](../CONTRIBUTORS.md) & [PythonJournos](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/PythonJournos)
